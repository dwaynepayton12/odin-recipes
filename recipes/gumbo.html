    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>New Orleans is a melting pot of extravagant culture, abundant energy, live music and it’s Creole cuisine. I traveled there a few years back for work, and I didn’t know it at the time, but when I had my first taste of delicious gumbo, I was hooked! It immediately became my favorite dish from Louisiana.

        A few days ago, my father-in-law handed me an amazing gift, a 15-year-old cookbook from his visit to the Crescent City! I quickly skimmed through it and found numerous recipes from some of the best restaurants at the time, like Commander’s Palace and Brennan’s. When I came across chicken Andouille sausage gumbo, I knew I had to give it a try and share with you the delicious</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>2 pounds chicken, boneless skinless breast and thigh recommended</ol>
        <li>2 quarts water</li>
        <li>1 pound okra, 1-inch slices (cut and frozen if fresh is not available)</li>
        <li>½ cup water, to cook the okra</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups yellow onion, ¼-inch dice</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups bell pepper, ¼-inch dice, green and red</li>
        <li>⅓ cup celery, ¼-inch dice</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 cups diced canned tomatoes</li>
        <li>12 ounces Andouille sausage, cooked, sliced</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf, dried</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon thyme, dried</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon basil, dried</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or chili pepper (use less for lower spiciness)</li>
        <li>▢½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon gumbo file, Zatarain's</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <li>In a medium-sized pot, add chicken breast and thighs and cover with 2 quarts of water. Bring water to a boil, then simmer until fully cooked about 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Strain water and reserve.</li>
        <li>Remove cooked chicken from the pot, allow it to cool then shred into small pieces. Cover and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium-sized saucepan, add okra and ½ cup of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cover. Simmer for 7-9 minutes until tender, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Transfer okra to a colander, drain, then reserve.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, combine ½ cup unsalted butter and ½ cup flour. Cook over medium heat, frequently stirring with a whisk to make a dark brown roux, about 15 minutes. In the last 5 minutes make sure to continuously stir so the roux does not burn.</li>
        <li>Add onion, bell peppers, celery, and garlic. Sauté until vegetables are tender, about 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add cooked okra, tomatoes, and sliced Andouille sausage. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add bay leaf, thyme, basil, cayenne, pepper, and salt</li>
        <li>Add 4 cups of the reserved water (from step 2), mix well. You may add more water depending on how thick you want the gumbo.</li>
        <li>Simmer over medium-low heat, for approximately 30 minutes with pot loosely covered, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat, and slowly stir in the gumbo file. Do not reboil after adding as this tends to make the gumbo stringy. Taste and season with more salt and pepper as desired.</li>
        <li>Serve over steamed rice.</li>
