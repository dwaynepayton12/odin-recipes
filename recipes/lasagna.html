    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Lasagna is the perfect meal – it keeps, reheats and freezes really well and it is so nice to have something in the fridge to enjoy throughout the week. Also, think: Meal Planning! It also works well for kids lunches – I pack a serving in my son’s thermos to keep it hot and that thermos comes home empty :).</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>80/20 beef (20% fat content) </ul>
    <ul>9 lasagna noodles for a 9×13 casserole dish</ul>
    <ul>maranaira sauce</ul>
    <ul>red wine,orbeef broth if you want.</ul>
    <ul>mozzerella cheese</ul>
    <ul>onions, bell peppers and garlic. and some italian seasoning</ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</ol>
    <ol>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</ol>
    <ol>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</ol>
    <ol>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</ol>
